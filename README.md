Sales Strategy Optimization - Driving Revenue Growth Through Predictive Analytics
Project Overview

This project aims to enhance an e-commerce company's sales strategy through predictive analytics. The company, despite its large product range and international operations, is struggling to grow its revenue. We use data-driven insights to develop targeted strategies focusing on high-performing products, regions, and sales representatives, while addressing underperformance in other areas.
Problem Statement

E-commerce companies with established product portfolios are finding it challenging to boost revenue. Despite expanding their product offerings and entering new markets, sales growth has been stagnant. This project addresses the following key challenges:

    Product Focus: The top 10% of products drive 60% of the sales, leaving many underperforming products.
    Regional Performance: Some regions are not performing as expected, indicating that a one-size-fits-all strategy isn't effective.
    Sales Team Efficiency: The performance of the sales team varies across regions and product lines.

Objectives

The goal is to analyze sales data to identify what's working and where the gaps are, and to develop a more targeted sales strategy:

    Focus on high-performing products and regions.
    Improve sales in underperforming areas.
    Boost sales team efficiency through data-driven insights.
